class EloTeamBalancer:
    '''
    From a list of tuples or lists of Players (username, elo), create an instance
    for creating a dictionary of team balancing information.

        Args:
            players (:obj:`Iterable[Tuple(str, float)]`): A list of players and their respective elo rating.

            k_constraint: (:obj:`Optional[int]`): take only :obj:`k` best combinations of teams based on
                team elo ratings. If omitted, take all the combinations of both teams.

            elo_diff_constraint (:obj:`Optional[float]`): Filter the team combinations that have an difference
            of their respective elo averages less than the constraint. If omitted, take all teams regardless of
            their elo differences.

            player_balance_constraint (:obj:`Optional[bool]`): Filter the team combinations that have a "good
            mix" of players, where, given the set of two players ordered by their elo ratings, the players
            cannot be on the same team (e.g., the two best players cannot be on the same team, the next two
            best players cannot be on the same team, etc.)

        Returns:
            :obj:`None`

            player_names = list('ABCDEFGHIJ')
